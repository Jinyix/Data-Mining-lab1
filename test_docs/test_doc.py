doc5 = 'Hello, my comments are given below, and I hope they will be useful for your project. Good luck with your studies! General impression, context and content The first thing that caught my attention in this evaluation is that it covered the strengths and weaknesses of more than one study. I think this precludes deeper explanation. I agree with the terms used for strengths and weaknesses. Also, the terms and explanations are consistent each other. However, some parts are unclear, and they could have been defined in detail. For example, for Study 1, it is stated that there might be random errors, or this study cannot fulfil external validity. It would be helpful to put some definitions or examples for readers like what is external validity. In my opinion, it may be a good way that the most important strength and weakness can be explained after summarizing all methods in the article. Structure and outline In introduction, although the subject of the article is presented it would be better if there are some background information about study. A brief summary, including what is DMT and what is main purpose of this study, could be added to warm up the reader in the beginning. The sequence is consistent but as I said previous part, it can be another option to explain the studies and methods before and to give evaluation about strengths and weakness of the study after. Lastly, more detailed conclusion showing the alternative methods and improvements related to methods will be more satisfying for the reader. Language and formatting The language of the evaluation is quite easily understandable and simple for the reader who has less information about the article. Furthermore, the paragraphs flows smoothly and there are useful words to link the paragraphs. My only comment about it, this article can be further developed pedagogically by adding some examples and definitions to make clear some terms.'
doc6 = 'I agree with the strength and weaknesses given as examples for the different methods. I think the weakness of no external validity is important and well described. I would like the operationalizations to be explained a bit more, what is the observed feature they are measuring for example. I think it was good that the strength of the hypothesis was described in study 2, would be nice if it was done for all the study 1 and 3 as well. I also think the observer effect was important and well explained. I think the text has a good structure with the three different methods and their strength and weaknesses. I think it would be nice with an introduction and a quick background of the concepts, now I had a hard time understanding the studies that were made. I still think the strength and weaknesses was described well but an introduction could further increase readability. The conclusion was nice with the most prominent weaknesses and strengths. Overall, the text is understandable and easy to read. It is dry but I think that is to be expected in this certain report and I understand that its hard to make it lively and “fun” to read. I think and introduction with some background would help readability. There are some grammatical errors and some choices of words that make it a bit hard to understand the text but overall, it was good.'
